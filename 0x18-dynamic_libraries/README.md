# 0x18. C - Dynamic Libraries

## Overview

This project focuses on dynamic libraries in C, covering topics such as creating, using, and understanding the differences between dynamic and static libraries. Additionally, the use of environment variables like $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and basic tools like `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig` are explored.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what a dynamic library is, how it works, and how to create and use one.
- Utilize the environment variable $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and comprehend its usage.
- Differentiate between static and shared libraries.
- Employ basic tools such as `nm`, `ldd`, and `ldconfig` in managing dynamic libraries.

# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

This project covers various search algorithms in C, including linear search and binary search. The tasks focus on understanding different search algorithms, their implementations, and when to use them based on specific needs.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without the help of Google:

### General

- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library. Any call to another function like strdup, malloc, … is forbidden.
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

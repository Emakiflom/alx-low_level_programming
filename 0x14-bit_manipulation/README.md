# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

This project focuses on bit manipulation in the C programming language. It covers various concepts and techniques related to working with bits.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should follow the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- Global variables are not allowed
- Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
- Only the C standard library functions `malloc`, `free`, and `exit` are allowed. Functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc`, etc., are forbidden
- You are allowed to use the `_putchar` function
- The `_putchar.c` file should not be pushed to the repository. The provided `_putchar.c` file will be used for compilation.
- The prototypes of all functions, including `_putchar`, should be included in the header file `main.h`
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All header files should have include guards

## Files

Here is a list of the files in this project:

- [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
- [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
- [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): A function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.
- [main.h](./main.h): The header file that contains all function prototypes.

## Usage

To compile the files, use the following command:
